## Exercises Shell Scripting !

### EXERCISE-1

Create a script that checks if a number is divisible by either 2, 3 or 5.
Create a function that does that.
_Hint_: A number, say 18, is divisible by 3 if the reminder of the division 18/3 is 0, otherwise it is not divisible by 3. Review the lesson on **“Arithmetic Expressions”** and **“IF Conditions”** in case you have any doubts.

In this exercise after creating some .txt and .jpg files, 
we will let the user choose either the .jpg or the .txt files, 
and rename all these files.

- Create any number of different .txt files and .jpg files.
- Let the user choose either the .jpg or the .txt files and
keep asking until the user press either “j” or “t”.
- Let the user choose a Prefix to add to the name of all the selected files
(all the .jpg or all the .txt files).
- Rename all the selected files adding this prefix to their name.
