## Intro to the project

이번 프로젝트는 두개의 파트로 나뉘어져 있음.
1. Terminal Project 1
	- Extract information about a certain topic, searching all files in a certain folder
		1. Inside a folder search for all files containing a specific word
		2. Create a folder and copy those files in this folder
		3. At the end of each copied file, add the file number at which you found the hot-word
2. Terminal Project 2
	- Create a script that does the same thing, but searching also within ALL folders within the main folder
